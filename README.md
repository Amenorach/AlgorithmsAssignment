The codes to this file are in two parts namely: Part 1(Binarysearch.py) and Part 2(stringmatch.py).

For both of them, there is the file reading aspect where the user inputs the name of a textfile with characters in them and the index of the selected character is highlighted.
There is also the interactive aspect where the user is able to input integers or text into the command prompt and also will get the index of the selected character(s).
